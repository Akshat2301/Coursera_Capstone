London is a city with a high population and population density. As from Real
Estate investor point of view we want to invest in such places were the housing
prices are low and the facilities (shops, restaurants, parks, Hotels, etc.) and social
venues are nearby.
Keeping above things in mind it is very difficult for an individual to find such place
in such big city and gather this much information.
When we consider all these problems, we can create a map and
information chart where the real estate index is placed on London and each
district is clustered according to the venue density.
